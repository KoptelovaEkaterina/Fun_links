https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl

Bashcrawl is a game that teaches you how to use the linux command line.
"In Bashcrawl, a "dungeon" is created in the form of directories and files on your computer. You explore the dungeon by using the cd command to change directory into each room of the dungeon. As you proceed through directories, you examine files with ls -F, read files with cat, set variables to collect treasure, and run scripts to fight monsters."
